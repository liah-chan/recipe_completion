Here you have to create the profits datasets using the profits.py script.
The combinations I would like you to try are:
 - contexts + cooccurs
 - vec_contexts + cooccurs
 - contexts only
 - vec_contexts only

Use the ingredient vectors that you think behaved the best on the basis of the 
experiments you made so far.
